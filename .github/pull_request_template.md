# Checklist

## All Submissions

- [ ] Attached log with the results of functional testing using `software_path` and/or `hardware_path`.
Required testing coverage depends on the nature of the changes.
For example, changes to the API (`c_api/`, `cpp_api/` folders) or middle-layer (`middle_layer/`) imply testing of both;
however, changes focused on `core/` require only `hardware_path` testing.
If testing is not possible on the contributor side (for example, due to lack of resources), let the maintainers know.
More information on testing is in [Documentation](https://intel.github.io/DML/documentation/get_started_docs/testing.html#).
